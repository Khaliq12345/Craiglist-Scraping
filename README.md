# Craiglist-Scraping
Scraping Craiglist with BeautifulSoup

I’ve been looking to make a move recently. 
And what better way to know I’m getting a good price than to sample from the “population” of housing on Craigslist? Sounds like a job for…Python and web scraping!

The code here, and/or the URI parameters rather, can be modified to pull from any region, category, property type, etc. Pretty cool, huh?

Let get started!!
